## Case study: The Tax Computation Service

We consider here a simple case study, the _Tax Computation Service_. The key idea is simple: creating a approver.service-based architecture to support the computation of income taxes for a relatively small country (_i.e._, Norway, 5 millions inhabitants).

### Personas & Stories

  * _Thor_ is a simple tax payer, working as a software engineer in Oslo, the biggest city of the country; As Thor ...
    * I want to receive an email containing my tax return form when my taxes were processed, so that I can know the amount of taxes I paid this year;
    * I want to submit my cousin's name to the system, so that I can see how many taxes he is paying this year.
  * _Anders_ is Thor's cousin. He works as a farmer living in Fredvang, a small village located inside the Lofoten archipelago; As Anders, ...
    * I want my taxes to be handled as a farmer so that I can benefit from the special tax computation associated to this status;
    * I want to receive my tax return form by snail mail, so that I can read it without using a computer;
    * I want to receive a text message  indicating that my tax return was processed. 
  * _Eva_ is working at Skatteetaten, the Norwegian Tax Administration. She is supervising the tax payment process at the kingdom level; As Eva, ...
    * I want to respect the Norwegian law, stating that all processing must be done in an anonymous way; 
    * I want to know how many tax return forms were processed .
  * _Camilla_ is an IT engineer, also working at Skatteetaten. She is ensuring that the computation load will not kill the tax collection process. As Camilla, ...
    * I want to supervise the operational system to monitor how the tax processing is going.

### Phase #2: Integrating services

  * Message broker
    * [ ] Using asynchronous messages to assemble services;
    * [ ] Monitoring the broker 
  * Legacy integration
    * [ ] Leveraging adapters to integrate legacy systems together
